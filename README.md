Graduate lab project at Rochester Institute of Technology by Imaging Science PhD students of year 2016

The HTPA80x64d is the bigger brother of the 32x32d infrared array sensor with a resolution of 80x64 Pixel inside a TO8 housing. Due to the digital SPI interface only 6 pins are needed. It has a built in EEPROM to store all calibration data and a 16-bit ADC. The Speed can be set internally via the sensor clock and ADC-resolution up to 20 Hz (highest resolution) or up to 200 Hz (lowest resolution).

Please refer to the documentation files for the complete communication protocal of the Infrared Thermopile Array Sensor HTPA80x64dL10_0k7F7k7Hi .
